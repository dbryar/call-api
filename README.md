# Goodbye REST. Hello... what?

REST is dead in an agentic world. What should an alternative look like?

This was born out of a [Blog](https://daniel.bryar.com.au/posts/2026/02/goodbye-rest-hello-cqrs/) where I posted that REST, while easy for humans to understand, is no good for agentic interaction. For that we have MCP.

But why maintain two separate contracts for your two distinct audiences? Surely there is a way we can make both human (developer) and agent interactions use the same mechanics for API interactions.
